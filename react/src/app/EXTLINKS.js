                Javadrive is a Japanese online resource programming website for beginners.
                It contains examples on Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, Javascripts, etc.
                <br /><br />
                I learned Java from Javadrive 10 years ago for working on my final year project.
                By referring to the JFreeChart example, I managed to develop my program with data representation in chart.
